<p>Tonight after smoking a modest amount of dried home-grown cannabis (and not very high quality cannabis but, nevertheless, of decent quality for inducing a functional high) I got the following ideas which seemed useful to write down:</p>
<p><em>It is beyond the scope of my abilities as an ego to determine whether or not I am being phony. Someone other than myself would presumably be able to discern my degree of phoniness better than I ever could because I structurally lack a perceptive and cognitive distance between myself (as object) and myself (as observer).</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps the previous claims are examples of phoniness. What might be truer is the claim that <span style="background:#ffff00">it is beyond the scope of my abilities as an ego to determine whether or not I have attained omniscience.</span></em></p>
