<p>Between 8:00PM and 10:00PM karbytes briefly played an acoustic drum set and made a 57 video recording of that drumming session and uploaded that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_30/main/instagram_karbytes_07_june_2023_part_5.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> to Instagram and GitHub. According to karbytes, the drumming in that video is not particularly good because the tempo lags at one point in that video and because the verses which karbytes thought sounded good only lasted for a few verses. The video was mostly comprised of hastily implemented fills just to compact as much variety without losing tempo into as small of a temporal space as possible. Also, karbytes was feeling a bit tense from dealing with stressful issues not pertaining to the relatively pleasurable experience of immersing onself in the listening and creation of music without too much of a sense of being rushed to hurry up and finish (or quit before finishing) due to external circumstances (which are typically social or economic in nature). (While uploading the video to Instagram using the house Wi-Fi, the video upload paused before completing seemingly due to other humans deciding to force karbytes to abort the upload or else go outside the house to finish the upload (and such a phenomenon has happened every other time karbytes attempted to upload a video from its phone to Instagram while at its house of legal residence whether karbytes was using the house Wi-Fi or else karbytes&#8217; mobile phone data)). Overall, by karbytes assessment, the video is worth keeping online because it helps to add to the aesthetic and sense of variety karbytes&#8217; cyberspace brand is attempting to showcase but the video is worse than legitimate listening quality music. karbytes will probably not upload any more videos of itself playing the drums until karbytes records a legitimately listening quality session (and karbytes has other projects to work on which are considered by karbytes to be higher priority than drumming and music making in general).</p>
