more rules to live by...

To avoid inciting other people's jealousy, insecurity, and animosity, avoid bragging about your personal accomplishments and fortunate circumstances, and happy mood. Strive to maintain a relatively stoic and stable demeanor of nonchalance and emotional detachment (which also helps prevent needy or dysfunctional people from using you as a source of psychological support (and such psychological support is available to such persons from mental health professionals)).
