<p>Within the past two weeks I remember seeing a brief video clip on Instagram of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardi B</a> riding in the car and the caption of that video saying that she was feeling a sense of longing to move to the countryside with her kids to enjoy more privacy in a rural setting and away from the relatively cramped and crowded urban settings and to not be so prominent in the media. I thought that, because she is wealthy from being a world famous musician that she could afford to do that and even hire a nanny to take care of her kids for most days of the week while Cardi B can enjoy most days in solitude if she prefers to in order to develop previously unexplored interests she might have been wanting to get around to but could not because she had to play a certain kind of role for the public eye and also be preoccupied with her career as a very public celebrity.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I imagined someone attempting to watch some videos I have been watching which go into technical detail about rather intellectual subject matter and that person &#8220;freaking out&#8221; because that person could not sustain concentration nor comprehend the video without feeling intimidated or bored by such relatively advanced subject matter. I would recommend that such a viewer engage in some kind of self improvement program by doing exercises which help to develop latent mental faculties such as reading, mindfulness meditation, physical fitness exercises, taking psychoactive drugs or pharmaceuticals for psychiatric conditions, or routinely talking to a therapist or life coach. If such self improvement measures fail to be effective at helping that person be able to watch those videos without &#8220;freaking out&#8221; in the manner I described, then perhaps that person should assume that they have a permanently insurmountable learning disability and change their goals and priorities to accommodate such a disability so that the person is not wasting time and energy doing things which are ineffective and stressful and, instead, things which they are capable of deriving some semblance of achievement from.</p>
<p>Perhaps such a person would find the most security in doing full time &#8220;pink collar&#8221; or else &#8220;blue collar&#8221; work instead of settling for being unemployed. &#8220;Pink collar&#8221; jobs included cashiering, waiting tables at a restaurant, and dancing at a strip club. &#8220;Blue collar&#8221; jobs include janitorial jobs, warehouse jobs, and delivery driver jobs. Such jobs will enable such a person to afford most basic expenses (and, by being employed consistently full time at such jobs, that person might be eligible for government assistance to cover expenses such as medical care, food, and housing as a &#8220;low income&#8221; earner).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">If you have decided to accept the diagnosis of having a permanently insurmountable learning disability or some other serious disability which does not seem to be reversible, then you should probably settle for not basing your happiness in life on accomplishing goals which your disability seems to prevent you from accomplishing. Try to take pleasure in moment-to-moment experiences</span> such as eating delicious food, watching good movies, going on outings with friends and family, doing arts and crafts, having sex, raising a family, and attending church. Base your sense of self worth and motivation to continue living on something other than personal achievement and having to be recognized for doing something revolutionary and, instead, take pride in your humility, kindness, patience, faith in a &#8220;higher power&#8221; (i.e. faith in the existence and intervention of some transcendent divine entity which you can rely on to provide all that is good in your life instead of putting pressure on yourself to be the source of that goodness).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">If your attempts to have a good attitude or faith in a &#8220;higher power&#8221; fail to be effective, then you should probably settle for being a stoic whose primary mission in continuing to survive is to simply survive. Take pride in your ability to endure adversity, boredom, loneliness, loss, tragedy, betrayal, and intense physical suffering. If possible, look for examples of other people who are suffering or who have suffered in a similar manner so that you do not feel so alone.</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Due to habitable spaces becoming overcrowded by human lifespans extending and/or human population growth rate exceeding human death rate beyond a certain threshold and/or human consumer habits and corporate and government activity depleting the environment of commodities needed to endow every human with an enjoyable standard of living, it is likely that human civilization will become jail-like where people have few choices and are confined to cramped prison cells for most if not all of their time. Suicide may be an option and it might spare you from experiencing prolonged suffering from stress-related diseases from living in inescapable destitution. Suicide attempts which are unsuccessful might worsen the remainder of your life by giving you crippling injuries or you might end up incarcerated in mental institutions or actual prisons for essentially breaking the law by committing the &#8220;anti social&#8221; act of attempted suicide.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The kind of content I wish to share on my social media websites (e.g. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://twitter.com/karbytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>) is meant to help give the general public alternatives to mainstream media. I think that mainstream media generally promotes malaise and intellectual stuntedness and offers little in the way of genuinely inspiring examples of humanity. <span style="background:#ffff00">I curate my social media profiles with the intent of giving people access to informational resources which I think promote a higher quality human existence than what most other people, mainstream public figures, and mainstream media outlets tend to promote.</span> If you only follow what is popular, then I am afraid that you will be severely deprived of what I consider to be adequate examples of human potential being expressed. I think that the content I share via social media may even be life-saving and help to prevent people from wasting their lives on relatively shallow, banal, depressing, and wasteful entertainment and thought processes.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Humor is a skill. It might help to make what would otherwise intolerable for you at least somewhat more tolerable for you. Humor and intelligence tend to reinforce each other. (I did not highlight this part because only advanced audiences will appreciate it the way I want them to (which is something other than taking offense or getting more depressed or feeling confused by not understanding what I am talking about)).</p>
<p>Along with seeming to coincide with a high degree of intelligence, a high degree of humor seems to coincide with a high degree of empathy. People who are highly empathic are probably not as likely as people who are low in empathy to be violent, destructive to the environment, and to otherwise perpetuate misery in the world.</p>
