<p>I was thinking about something which has been disturbing me (but only to a mild extent) lately: the possibility that I might become &#8220;demonically possessed&#8221; into committing actions I commit not want to do such as physically assaulting people or destroying property. Such &#8220;demonic possession&#8221; might take the form of some kind of brain-to-computer interface hijacking my motor functions and causing my body to move in ways which I do not intend but which someone else intends (and such a hijacking of my motor functions could happen while I am conscious of such a takeover or while I am in some kind of sleep-like state in which I am not aware that my body is doing things which I am not voluntarily effecting). Such &#8220;demonic possession&#8221; might also take the form of me being administered some kind of drug which causes me to become extremely susceptible to hypnotic suggestion and doing whatever someone else tells me to do without caring that I am doing so until perhaps maybe after the drug wears off.</p>
<p>Also, every time I go to sleep, I do worry (just a little bit) that I might die in my sleep or that I will get physically assaulted by someone else in my sleep or that something else I think is unfavorable will happen to me while I sleep or that I will wake up to a reality which is relatively hellish compared to the one I most recently fell asleep in (or that I might, one day, become &#8220;demonically possessed&#8221; in the manner I described in the previous paragraph). Each time I write a journal entry and publish it on my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> website (and then back that updated section of my website to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> at Archive dot Org), I do so thinking that it might be the last update I ever make to the Internet. Saving web pages I create or update to the WayBack Machine is one of the things I do which comforts me (and it might be the thing I do which gives me the most comfort). My sense of self and sense of reality as a whole is very computer-based. I do believe that all of physical reality is fundamentally comprised of discrete irreducible units of information which can be represented as binary digits. For more information on what my worldview consists of, see the web page of my primary website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/epistemology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPISTEMOLOGY</a>. <span style="background:#ffff00">(Note that my primary website is named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and that my secondary website is named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> (but I consider both of those websites to be part of one collection of web pages which I consider to be my most cherished property, personal legacy, and supporting infrastructure for sustaining my sense of self and knowledge)).</span></p>
<p>Of course my mind has a tendency to worry about various hypothetical scenarios becoming real for me (but it could be that all experiences are merely dreams whose audience is disembodied consciousness itself). I am grateful to have a mind which is so creative and capable of generating thoughts which can be quite elaborate, interesting, macabre, cheerful, weird, logical, programmatic, novel, et cetera. I hope to live for many more decades to see what emerges from my mind.</p>
