<p>Some people seem to think that, the longer a human lives, the more likely that human is to experience cancer resulting from the genetic information which is encoded in that human&#8217;s cells getting corrupted from exposure to carcinogenic chemicals and radiation from that human&#8217;s environment.</p>
<p>Some people also seem to think that a reduction in a human&#8217;s cognitive functions, sensory functions, motor functions, immunity to disease, and general physiological functioning is a function of that human aging (and that such decline is inevitable).</p>
<p>I disagree that such decline is inevitable. I think that it is physically possible for a human to extend its lifespan and to maintain its cognitive functions, sensory functions, motor functions, immunity to disease, and general physiological functioning for as long as environmental conditions remain hospitable to that human&#8217;s survival and ability to procure the necessary material inputs and procedures involved in cultivating new tissues from that human&#8217;s own <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells</a> and incrementally replacing diseased or &#8220;irreparably damaged&#8221; tissues in that human&#8217;s body with anatomically identical lab grown components.</p>
<p>I hope to live long enough to see such advancements in medical technology become effective and accessible for all humans who are alive. I expect that such advancements may be in effect as soon as the year 2050 (which is the year I would be turning 60 years old). Regardless of whether or not I live to see such a vision come to fruition, I intend to, nevertheless, do everything in my power to maintain my physical and mental fitness (even if I do not live as long as I want to and even if I end up committing suicide as a result of deciding that what I perceive to be detrimental aspects of my continued existence canceling out what I perceive to be beneficial aspects of my continued existence (which, of course, is a subjective, arbitrary, speculative, and fluid analysis)).</p>
<p>I hope to survive for as long as physically possible without ever attempting suicide and, in doing so, doing my best to exemplify <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stoic</a> ideals (particularly the ideal of not overtly expressing uncontrolled emotionality and the ideal of not requiring that I experience uninterrupted euphoria in order for me to perceive my life as being worthy of my continued laborious investment in extending the runtime of).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">In a nutshell, my occupation as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person" target="_blank" rel="noopener">person</a> (which may or may not transform incrementally or abruptly from a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homo sapien</a> into a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyborg</a> and/or <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">android</a> and/or <strong>completely virtualized humanoid</strong> (and a virtualized humanoid is physically and logically equivalent to the classification of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> which lacks a physical body and is, instead, constrained to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberspace</a> exclusively (but, while in cyberspace, possibly able to interact with its encompassing physical universe))) is to be a skilled <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logician</a> (and to maximize my skills as a logician).
