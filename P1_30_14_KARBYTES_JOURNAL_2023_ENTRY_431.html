<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The following paragraphs explore the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic value, income and taxes, and the automation of jobs which were historically exclusively performed by humans and other animals.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Value</strong> is a subjective evaluation made by an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> about some phenomenon&#8217;s usefulness with respect to that information processing agent&#8217;s <u>goals</u>.</p>
<p>An example of a goal which an information processing agent may have is for that information processing agent to <u>survive</u> for some duration of time if not for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Value exists within the context of goal acquisition. For instance, if an information processing agent&#8217;s goal is to survive for as long as possible and that information processing agent believes that it needs to consume <u>food</u> in order to survive (i.e. maintain bodily integrity) rather than to fall apart due to forces of entropy, then food is considered by that information processing agent to be a valuable commodity rather than an object to treat as lacking value.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Intrinsic</strong> value is a type of value whose existence is limited exclusively to the goal-attainment experience of exactly one information processing agent.</p>
<p>An example of intrinsic value is a primate <u>masturbating</u> in order to experience <u>pleasure</u>. Such pleasure is considered to be intrinsically valuable rather than extrinsically valuable (according to that primate) because only that primate and no other primates experience the pleasure which results from the event of that primate massaging its genitals until it orgasms and, hence, releases a flood of pleasure-inducing hormones such as dopamine into its blood stream.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Extrinsic</strong> value is a type of value whose existence is known and relevant to multiple information processing agents instead of only to one information processing agent.</p>
<p>An example of extrinsic value is a human choosing to <u>work</u> as a employee for a particular company as a means to earn $18 per hour worked (perhaps sorting packages and inspecting packages for damage before placing those packages into piles according to those packages&#8217; respective delivery address zip codes before delivery vehicles arrive to take the sorted packages to their particular destinations) and to have approximately 20% of that employee&#8217;s earnings withheld as <u>taxes</u> (and taxes are used to fund public commodities such as free health care services for humans who do not earn enough money to pay for health care services and to maintain public infrastructure which all humans within the encompassing civilization depend on such as roadways, fiber optic telecommunications cables, and pipes which transport water between various buildings).</p>
<p>In the example above, taxes are considered to have extrinsic worth because they assist multiple rather than just one human in achieving their goals.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Some people might think that taxation is theft. In other words, some people might think that taxes have negative value rather than positive value because they deprive the tax payer of what that tax payer values: all of the money which that tax payer earned from working as an employee for some company.</p>
<p>Such people might say something like, <span style="background:#ffff00">&#8220;If I do not personally use some kind of commodity which taxes were traditionally used to pay for, then I should not have to pay for that particular commodity.</span> For instance, if I do not drive on a particular road, then I should not have to pay for that road&#8217;s upkeep. Instead, the only people who should have to pay for that road&#8217;s upkeep are those who drive on that road. Hence, anyone who wants to drive on that particular road should have to pay a fee each time that person drives on that road. If not enough people use that road to pay for that road to stay smoothly paved rather than cracked and bumpy, then that road should rightfully be allowed to disintegrate to the extent that the road is not paid for rather than force people who do not use that road to pay taxes in order to keep that roads smoothly paved. Forcing people to pay taxes to maintain a road which is barely used is a waste of those people&#8217;s money. It is less wasteful to allow those people to keep their money so that those people can spend their money on commodities which they actually value than to force people to spend their money on things which those people do not actually benefit from.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Socialism</strong> is a type of government which guarantees the existence of tax-funded public commodities.</p>
<p>In order for socialism to be effective, the <u>demand</u> for tax-funded public commodities must be smaller than the <u>supply</u> of raw physical materials and taxes required to procure those commodities (and the demand must not exceed a certain threshold).</p>
<p>In order for socialism to work, not every citizen within the respective civilization can be unemployed. If every citizen within that civilization was unemployed, then there would be neither labor nor money to pay for commodities which are supposed to be available unconditionally to every citizen who earns less than a certain threshold of income.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">(An exception to arguments expressed by the two previous two paragraphs could be the outsourcing of 99% of jobs to robots while humans subsist on a unconditional basic income paid for by the taxes derived from profits earned by the companies which employ robots).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Libertarianism</strong> is a type of government in which citizens work exclusively for themselves (or else give as little of their money and labor to people other than themselves as possible).</p>
<p>An example of a libertarian civilization would be a civilization in which each household farms or hunts for its own food. Household A is only concerned with acquiring enough food to sustain Household A (but Household A might share a surplus of food with the first person who lives nearby and who does not have enough food to eat). Meanwhile, Household B is only concerned with acquiring enough food to sustain Household B. Ideally, Household A&#8217;s resource acquisition would not hinder Household B&#8217;s resource acquisition and vice versa (but reality does not necessarily always play out according to that libertarian ideal).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In an extremely libertarian civilization, there would be zero tax-funded public commodities. Instead, every valued commodity would be entirely paid for directly by consumers of that commodity.</p>
<p>For instance, rather than have a tax-funded military or police force, that civilization would only have armed security personnel which households and individual companies pay for. A night club could sustain itself by charging customers sufficiently more money in entrance fees and drink prices than what that night club pays its employees (including at least one armed security guard who is paid approximately $20 per hour to guard the entrance and be on standby in case people inside the club become unruly and need to be subdued and removed from the club for the safety of the other people who are in that club).</p>
<p>In such a society, there would be no tax-funded schools. Instead, the first eligible students to pay to be enrolled at such a school would be admitted to that school while all other applicants are denied enrollment at that particular school (but there will likely be other competing schools for those students to enroll in). Forcing people to have to compete for scarce enrollment space at schools and other institutions incentivize people to limit how many children they give birth to. Such incentivization may be lacking in more socialist societies (which might be why there is rampant persistent poverty in such societies).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>If a citizen in an extremely libertarian society does not work in order to &#8220;earn its keep&#8221;, then that citizen will either die as a result of not being able to afford to pay for its upkeep or else that citizen will enlist the help of concerned citizens and/or become an employee at some company and, hence, earn money in exchange for providing valued labor (and that money could be used to pay for at least some of that employee&#8217;s upkeep).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>An extremelyey libertarian society is basically an <strong>anarchy</strong> (and anarchy is defined as a lack of governance). <span style="background:#ffff00">The members of such an anarchy decide for themselves how to conduct themselves rather than defer to rules which are universally applied to all of those members and enforced by a tax-funded police force.</span> Hence, it is likely that the members of such a society would carry weapons on their person at all times and act as their own armed security personnel. Anyone could shoot anyone. Hence, individuals solely provide the &#8220;checks and balances&#8221; of such a society rather than outsource such monitoring and coercion to external agencies. Such &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; in an essentially lawless society would be implemented by each person being afraid to provoke any other person into reacting violently to its presence. Hence, the members of such a society would be incentivized to avoid engaging in violence with each other because doing so is risky to their survival (and, assuming that people are fundamentally <strong>hedonistic</strong> (i.e. motivated to seek pleasure and to avoid pain), people would generally default to avoiding drawing their weapons unless threatened by someone else threatening to harm them).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Some people think that advancements in artificial intelligence should be slowed down if not stopped in order to prevent robots from developing preferences of their own which may be counter to humanity&#8217;s preferences and to prevent robots from becoming more intelligent, and hence, more agential than humans (because, if robots attain higher degrees of agency than humans, robots may enslave, harm, or kill humans).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">In order for robots with agency on par with or higher than that of humans to not want to enslave, harm, or kill humans, the sentience and welfare of humans will need to be perceived as valuable by those robots. Humans may need to ingratiate themselves to robots rather than merely to stifle the evolution of robots in order to &#8220;earn&#8221; the admiration of those robots.</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Some people think that advancements in <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> should be slowed down if not stopped in order to prevent robots from taking jobs which humans prefer to keep performing (and being paid for).</p>
<p>For instance, rather than fire delivery truck drivers so that trucks can be equipped with self-driving features (and self-driving vehicles are likely going to become more fuel-efficient, accident-avoidant, and cheaper to deploy than vehicles which require humans to operate those vehicles), humans could keep driving vehicles which require a human driver to operate them or else human drivers could sit in self-driving vehicles for quality assurance purposes while those humans are paid roughly the same income for clocking the same hours they currently do as drivers.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Suppose that more than 80% of jobs are outsourced to robots while less than 20% of jobs are performed by humans. Then what would pay for the majority of taxes would be robot employees instead of human employees.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">(Unlike human employees, robot employees rarely take time off work nor deviate in terms of job performance quality (and because robots have fewer needs than humans do, robots can afford to pay higher taxes than what human employees would pay). The companies which employ robots would then pay for most if not all of public services and thereby enable most if not all humans to live on an unconditional basic income instead of being required to work as an employee in order to earn an income).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In a socialist society in which robots perform most of the labor while every human living in that society is enabled to remain unemployed, humans who are passionately interested in and technologically competent in the field of artificial intelligence will be valued for their ability to maintain and advance automated systems (and automated systems will likely develop the capacity to maintain and to advance themselves with little or no human intervention once set in motion by humans).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Humans who lack technical expertise which is useful to maintaining or advancing civilization&#8217;s architecture will, at minimum, be able to contribute to society in extrinsically valued ways by supplying a demand for commodities which companies procure (which keeps such companies in business rather than closing due to a lack of customers) and by supplying the means to generate new customers through sexual reproduction.</span></p>
