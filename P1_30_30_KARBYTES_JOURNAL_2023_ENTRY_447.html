<p>While walking through the streets between 2:00AM and 3:00AM today, I had the following thoughts:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;In order for a man to evolve instead of perish at his current level, he must be fucked in the ass. In more colloquial terms, &#8216;Real men enjoy getting fucked in the ass (especially by women).'&#8221;</em></p>
<p>karbytes wrote the italicized quote above and then thought to include the following detail: when karbytes was still only Karlina and not yet karbytes, karbytes fucked SED in the ass with a strap-on dildo and SED said that the experience was &#8220;oddly pleasurable&#8221;. karbytes misses SED but is happy to have been significantly influenced by him as a mentor, friend, lover, and maybe now a brother. (What karbytes appreciated most about SED was his enthusiam for software engineering, video games, and science as a self-taught learner and unapologetic opportunist).</p>
<p>It should be noted that karbytes (while Karlina before becoming karbytes) lost its anal virginity first to SED and then karbytes lost its vaginal virginity to SED and that karbytes does not ever recall being raped or otherwise seriously physically harmed as a result of physical violence committed by humans (though karbytes has engaged in many violent confrontations with other humans over the course of its life time while no person involved in such fights got seriously injured).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00"><em>I imagine that this web page (and content which I publish and promote) would not be appealing to those who wish to remain virgins (i.e. never partaking in sex at any point in their lives) or straight edge (i.e. abstaining from drug use) in terms of psychedelic drug usage. Also, such content would only seemingly appeal to those who wish to maximize their understanding and mastery of subjects like calculus, physics, special relativity, quantum mechanics, and computer programming.</em></span></p>

<p>I also remembered going to University of California Merced in the autumn of the year 2008 after graduating from Castro Valley High School in June 2008 and meeting someone roughly four years older than me whose name I will abbreviate as JX (and she was a very assertive and sisterly Chinese immigrant who I ended up befriending and who I eventually developed a crush on but did not confess until I approximately three months after I dropped out of UC Merced to start attending Chabot College closer to home and getting approached by a student at Chabot College (in Hayward) who I referred to as SED and eventually allowing him to come over to my house and he was trying to court me and I was reluctant and then a love triangle formed where I had a crush on JX and JX had a crush on SED and SED had a crush on me). The only rave I ever remember going to was with just me and JX in San Francisco and I remember enjoying getting groped for about five minutes by some cute Asian guy and then feeling a rush of feeling powerful (i.e. like I had influence over other people and importance in their eyes) as I was waving glow sticks in front of some people who were stoned on some kind of drug and turning their heads to follow the movement of my light sticks as I put on a little light show for them.</p>
<p>I thought that it would be important to include the previous paragraph in this journal entry because it showed that I had a college life and that I am not as sheltered as some people might think I am because, over the past five plus years, I have basically lived like a schizoid and now more so than ever as a camp-aholic and someone who likes to spend most of its time near or in the forests and mountains and spending hours per day using my laptop computer most days of the week.</p>
