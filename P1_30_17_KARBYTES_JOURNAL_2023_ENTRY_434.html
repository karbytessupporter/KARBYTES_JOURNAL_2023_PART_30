<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Later Annotation: If I could sum up <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pig_gorl</a> in as few words as possible, it would be &#8220;fat vain bimbo&#8221;. If I could sum up pig_gorl&#8217;s motives in as few words as possible, it would be &#8220;taking up as much of karbytes&#8217; attention as possible&#8221;. (Whenever I focus my attention on something I am interested in which is a bit technical or esoteric instead of exclusively pandering to insecure, vapid, and whorish brats like pig_gorl, pig_gorl becomes even more desperate-sounding than normal to distract me with ugly sound effects (and, when she throws such tantrums, she sounds like she is protesting angrily against my &#8220;crime&#8221; of not worshiping her and for not treating her like she can do no wrong and that she deserves such preferential treatment merely on the basis of being a young female who is primed to make advertising her sexual availability the only thing she has going for her while using her lack of well-rounded personal development as an excuse to be treated as deserving to be coddled and pampered unconditionally). <strong>I wrote this journal entry as a means to hopefully, once and for all, provide a rebuttal to all of pig_gorl&#8217;s tauntings. Hence, karbytes strongly advises karbytes to not take the &#8220;rules to live by&#8221; enumerated below as anything but parody and indirect means of conclusively resolving what could otherwise be a conflict which continues to persist for much longer.</strong></span></p>

<p>The following &#8220;rules to live by&#8221; were written by karbytes for karbytes to implement:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Militant pessimism is advocated.</strong> Many people seem to be living in worse circumstances than what I am living in and many people seem to be a lot more irrational than I am. Hence, if my goal is to avoid getting ganged up on and attacked for provoking other people&#8217;s jealousy, my advice to myself is to not flaunt my optimism too overtly and to also not discourage anyone&#8217;s pessimism. Such pessimism might be a person&#8217;s preferred way of coping with stressful situations.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Do not complain about other people&#8217;s conduct or else risk getting injured or killed.</strong> (I recently saw a story in the news about a man getting stabbed to death on a train in response to asking people to turn down the volume of their music. Many reader comments of that news story appeared to be siding with the stabber instead of the victim of the stabbing by calling the victim entitled for expecting other people to cater to his preferences in public. I noticed a very high prevalence of angry, reactionary, and unsubstantial comments in the comments to Instagram posts lately. I do not want to contribute to such an echo chamber of misery mongering and shallowness mongering nor be a victim of violence in response to imposing on any stranger&#8217;s personal space no matter how meager my imposition is).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Be your own best friend (but do not make it obvious to other people in your midst).</strong> They might punish you for being &#8220;criminally self absorbed&#8221; instead of &#8220;sufficiently involved in the lives of others&#8221;.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Do not point out other people&#8217;s factual incorrectness, logical fallacies, hypocrisy, or what you find to be distasteful content or means of communication of content.</strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>Compartmentalize your creative/cyberspace identity away from your employment/legal/&#8221;in person&#8221; identity such that you effectively live a double life.</strong></p>
<p>6. <strong>Lie, cheat, steal, and deploy violence only as minimally necessary to achieve your goals (according to your own discretion and not according to someone else&#8217;s direct consultation).</strong> Every behavior or event is ethically justified in at least one context. Therefore, <strong>you are advised by me to not discuss ethics because it is a waste of time and energy.</strong> If you think that not abiding by any of the rules listed on this web page would be more beneficial to you in terms of accomplishing your goals, then it is advised that you do not abide by that particular rule.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Believe that any friends you have always have the potential to be your enemy. Hence, exploit them for what you think they are worth and avoid relying on any one person too much. Rather than be dependent on a small number of persons for supporting your goals, build and maintain a vast network of professional persons such that you have a social safety net to fall back on when self reliance is insufficient or else impossible in the context of pursuing your goals.</strong></p>
<p>8. <strong>Suicide is an option but only use as a last resort to mitigate your suffering.</strong></p>
<p>9. <strong>Avoid gossiping, bullying, or effecting revenge on any person in order to mitigate the suffering you experience.</strong> You will probably hate yourself less if you are not an asshole to other people.</p>
<p>10. <strong>To avoid inciting other people&#8217;s jealousy, insecurity, and animosity, avoid bragging about your personal accomplishments and fortunate circumstances, and happy mood. Strive to maintain a relatively stoic and stable demeanor of nonchalance and emotional detachment</strong> (which also helps prevent needy or dysfunctional people from using you as a source of psychological support (and such <span style="background:#ffff00">psychological support is available to such persons from mental health professionals or <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international suicide hotlines</a></span>)).</p>
