<p>It is shortly after midnight. I am sitting in the garage with the lights off and I am downloading some <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black metal</a> compilation videos from YouTube to listen to offline later. Such music provides a distinct and pleasing ambience for studying and just enjoying the beauty of the wilderness on my solitary camping trips when I venture into the mountains northeast of my neighborhood. Such music is also fun to listen to at my house because my house is filled with my Norwegian immigrant grandmother&#8217;s artifacts (and black metal originated in Norway). What I like most about that particular genre of music (and Scandinavian metal in general) is the varied time signatures. I am generally not a big fan of shrill guitar solos but I do love distorted rhythm guitar and highly technical drumming (and tones and timbres which are decisively &#8220;dark&#8221;, &#8220;brutal&#8221;, &#8220;melodic&#8221;, and in some cases, &#8220;spiritual&#8221; in a satanic sense). The guttural growls and screaming vocals sound refreshingly inhuman and appropriately foreboding. The end result is a soundtrack which evokes macabre and adventurous fantasy.</p>
<p>Perhaps my favorite song in the list depicted by the screenshot is &#8220;Horrors of a Withered Dimension&#8221; by Bloodstained Ground.</p>
<p>Note to self: take a screenshot of the compilation video description if it shows the song titles and artist names in case that video or channel gets deleted so that you can look up individual songs from that album video to find as singles elsewhere. (Last year I saved a screenshot of and link to a black metal compilation video which has since been deleted and so has the YouTube channel which published it; but at least my <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_107/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a> preserved the details I needed to look up songs I otherwise would have a difficult if not impossible time trying to find without such a reference).</p>
