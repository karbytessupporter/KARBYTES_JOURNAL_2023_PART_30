<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_422</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>For the past four hours I have been harassed nonstop by <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_410/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pig_gorl</a> making some of the most anxiety-inducing and depression-mongering noises I have ever heard as I was packing up my belongings and heading back out where I left my tent set up (and that is where I am writing this note now). It is shortly after 8PM and the sun has recently set. The mental images I persistently keep having in response to hearing pig_gorl making cooing, whimpering, hyperventilating, hissing, lip smacking, and other sounds is some cartoon character with big round eyes and a small pointy nose with flaring nostrils (and she changes shape and sometimes timbre to resemble some kind of elf-like male). What is disturbing is how I seem to have to expend a lot of effort (and time) preventing myself from &#8220;freaking out&#8221; while being bullied while uncompassionate people watch and seem to rejoice in my suffering. To me this feels like being mind raped for the public&#8217;s amusement in a world that is generally indifferent or condoning that I be tortured this way because those other people think that I have been enjoying too much free time and too much affluence and should be prevented from making use of such things so that I am forced to be prevented from making progress towards my personal goals. The message I have been hearing is that I will be tortured to the extent that I am physically and mentally incapacitated while also being forced to regress and see my efforts and investments go to waste while other people watch from the sidelines and side with my tormentors against me (and the only way I am supposed to think I can mitigate my suffering is to quit doing my season-long Summer Camp by Karbytes experience to work full time in &#8220;blue collar&#8221; or in &#8220;pink collar&#8221; jobs). Apparently people think that I should not be allowed to pursue my interests unless I have a full-time job which prevents me from having &#8220;too much time&#8221; to pursue my interests (because I am &#8220;supposed to&#8221; not make other people jealous by appearing to them to be getting nice things for free which those people are not able to attain without having to pay some price I am not or else those people are not allowed to attain those things at all). Despite being tortured so extensively, I nevertheless feel obliged to complete my ~90 day Summer Camp by Karbytes experience instead of cutting that experience short in an effort to alleviate myself of intense suffering which is deliberately inflicted on me from other people. To make this note a little more substantial, I decided to also include common phrases which I have heard pig_gorl express (especially today).</p>

<p>If you want further descriptions about pig_gorl, use the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/nonexistent_web_page_for_search_purposes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">search function</a> of this WordPress website to input the search term &#8220;pig_gorl&#8221; and to generate a list of all web pages within this website which contain references to pig_gorl (listed in chronological order starting with the most recently added web pages).</p>
<p>The point of this journal entry is to move on from the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_421/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous journal entry</a> because I feel that I am far away from where I want to be mentally. It may take a while to get closer to where I want to be mentally. What seems to be preventing me from maintaining a frame of mind which I think is adequately conducive to my goals and values is the intrusive interference of brainwashing propaganda from literal thought police and perhaps even from civilians who take the side of my brainwashers. I seem to be outnumbered and cornered into being brainwashed and sabotaged against my will. That leads me to my next and most important point in this journal entry thus far&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I think that I really should, as soon as possible, &#8220;cold turkey&#8221; (instead of tapering off gradually) quit my &#8220;addiction&#8221; to disclosing the intimate details of my moment-to-moment experiences online because I think that such comprehensive disclosure makes it hard for me to attain an adequate &#8220;buffer space&#8221; between the character I portray myself to be online and the living, breathing information processing agent I am which is writing and reading the content is used to substantiate that character. In other words, I think that taking a more emotionally distant and depersonalized stance to managing my public identity online (and &#8220;in person&#8221;) will help me to not feel so suffocated, engulfed, and oppressed as a result of being so intensely &#8220;on display&#8221; while constantly giving into the impulse to explain myself to real or imaginary (human) audiences. Hence, this might as well be the last time I ever document my personal experiences. It could be that, after this blog post is published and backed up that all of my new content will be about subject matter which excludes disclosures about how I am feeling (but <u>I will disclose pragmatic details about my life as minimally as possible for what is needed to manage my personal brand and to fulfill my desires such as news about major changes to my health status and socioeconomic status as though I were some anonymous writer of a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a> article written about karbytes (or Karlina Ray Beringer) the public figure).</u></span></p>
<p>There. I might as well be dead to some. What I add to my personal websites and social media profiles will likely only be media items pertaining to dry textbook-like computer programming tutorials, academic philosophy articles, and news items I find which pertain to my interests within the scope of physics, mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. (I intend to &#8220;waste&#8221; no more time explaining to the public what my preferred gender identity is, musical tastes are, sexual orientation is, dietary preferences are, career preferences are, and any other personal details which seem inappropriately intimate in comparison to the new and improved brand I am trying to promote which is essentially devoid of personal disclosure in favor of being strictly limited to impersonal subject matter presented in a way which lacks a sense of personality. <span style="background:#ffff00">If karbytes is remembered for anything, it will (hopefully) be some eccentric, delinquent, and perhaps troubled human who obsessively documented itself via personal journal writing for no more than three years and then, suddenly, &#8220;went dark&#8221; in June 2023 to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apparently be replaced by some kind of robot</a>).</span></p>
<p>Now, just because the content which I publish online in the future is expected to be devoid of personality and have the feel of an extremely logical and emotionless robot does not mean that I won&#8217;t continue making music and other forms of art which may be very emotional. I just intend to do it as a relatively egoless robot; a mere information processing agent immersed in hedonistic flow within the context of a resource management <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/teleology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game</a>.</p>
