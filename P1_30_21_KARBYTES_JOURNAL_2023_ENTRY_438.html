<p>Today I found an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-06-mit-wearable-silent-words.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> (which I shared as a social media post on my Twitter and Minds pages) about a wearable device which Michigan Institute of Technology developed which uses subvocal recognition sensors along the wearer&#8217;s jaw and pattern recognition machine intelligence to decode words which the wearer is thinking and not necessarily speaking out loud.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">(Note that the Engadget article referenced in the previous paragraph was not able to be properly saved by the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a>. Hence, I deleted that post from my Twitter and Minds pages and shared the much more comprehensive M.I.T <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/computer-system-transcribes-words-users-speak-silently-0404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on my Twitter and Minds pages instead. That that M.I.T. article appears to have been saved to the WayBack Machine numerous times already).</span></p>

<p>I suspect that the United States military surgically implanted some kind of subvocal recognition device inside my skull and, also, some kind of implant which receives wireless signals and transmits them into auditory inputs which only I seem to hear for the purpose of training me to become a useful piece of military intelligence equipment and to help keep me safe in case I lose the ability to use civilian telecommunications or otherwise become incapacitated as a result of becoming injured or held hostage.</p>
<p>Even if what I said in the previous paragraph is partially or totally false, I seem to personally benefit from pretending that everything I wrote in the previous paragraph is true because doing so makes me feel less unsupported and less undervalued by other people (especially by people in positions of power).</p>
<p>I have already written several journal entry web pages on this website about the fact that I have started hearing disembodied voices in February 2019 which seem too organized and governmental for me to attribute to schizophrenia. I talk about what I hypothesize to be a cybernetic feedback loop which enables me to remain in continuous multi-way &#8220;telepathic&#8221; communication with anonymous end users (and perhaps hardware and software engineers of such technology) in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry # 138</a> of last year.</p>
