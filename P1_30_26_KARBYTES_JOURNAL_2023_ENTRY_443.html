<p><em>Some people are meant to be used as disposable stepping stones for other people to walk across.</em></p>
<p><em>Some people are never used as stepping stones for other people to walk across.</em></p>
<p><em>Both types of people were necessary to produce the society we have.</em></p>
<p><em>A stepping stone person is valued for being a martyr who is sacrificed for other people&#8217;s advancement.</em></p>
<p><em>A non stepping stone person is valued for being an end user of society&#8217;s finest offerings.</em></p>

<p>Note that this text in the section above is meant by its author to be interpreted as a poem rather than as a description of non fictional events nor as a doctrine to guide one&#8217;s behavior and beliefs by.</p>

<p>A reader of the poem referenced in the section above this section suggested that the stepping stone people are not encouraged to pursue an education because the stepping stone people are mere livestock (and livestock are animals which humans keep inside of enclosures and feed for the purpose of eventually harvesting milk, eggs, and meat from those animals). That reader also suggested that the poem describes systemic symbolic cannibalism.</p>

<p>karbytes: &#8220;I decided to include the content in the above sections in a journal entry web page (and I am describing <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that journal entry</a> in that same journal entry). I think ethics are rather boring and difficult to formalize as logical instructions compared to mathematics and physics. <span style="background:#ffff00">I am more of an &#8216;is&#8217; person than an &#8216;ought&#8217; person.</span> Maybe someone committed arson in a Canadian forest on a large enough scale to force humans (especially residents of New York in the United States of America) to pay closer attention to environmental issues and, hence, spur more hasty transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources. At this point I would condone <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting electricity from nuclear fusion</a> reactions because such energy production produces large amounts of energy relatively cheaply and quickly (though my most preferred energy sources are non radioactive and otherwise non polluting of the air, water, soil, and space outside of Planet Earth&#8217;s biosphere (and I especially prefer <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photovoltaics</a> because of their versatility for space travel and solid state hardware)).&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="background:#ffff00">karbytes: &#8220;After my approximately 90 day <u>Summer Camp by Karbytes</u> experience is completed, I tentatively plan to resume working at a full-time package handling job while traveling by walking, riding the BART train, and eventually bicycling (because I need to buy a new bicycle first) with my backpack on and and while camping close to the warehouse employing me between warehouse shifts (and coming back to Castro Valley at least once per week).&#8221;</span></p>
