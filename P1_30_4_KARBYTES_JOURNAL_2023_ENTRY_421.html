<p>Today I was sleeping in past 10AM in my tent in the woods while having some dreams about weird experiences shopping at a boba tea shop in Castro Village. I&#8217;ll share some of the details of my dream before proceeding to talk about what happened &#8220;in real life&#8221; afterwards. So I was in some living room and a friend from my childhood named Andrea was there and we were both trying to go to sleep in that room. She was lying on some couch and I was lying on the floor (which makes sense because I have developed a preference to sit on the floor instead of on furniture as a result of spending so much time living outdoors and traveling by foot). I even think part of my dream was about some old white people exclaiming that I was doing the right thing by walking instead of driving because I was immersing myself in the beauty of nature and getting a good sense of interconnectedness of all things. That part of the dream might have been inspired by the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> I was watching around 6AM when the birds were chirping quite vigorously as night was fading into day and Daniel Schmachtenberger was talking about the importance of spending time appreciating the trees and other natural phenomena in one&#8217;s midst without assigning categories and subjective meanings to such things and, also, spending some time getting to know homeless people because such people seem to be especially astute about seeing the biosphere and human civilization from a &#8220;big picture&#8221; and interconnected view. Anyway, I woke up and decided to sleep in a few times before actually getting up around 1PM because I stayed up all night using my laptop computer in my secluded little &#8220;pocket house&#8221; in some forest northeast of Castro Valley. Back to the dream with Andrea in the living room. I remember trying to get my laptop to continuously play some kind of non-musical noise generator so that I could relax because I was apparently stressed out about some interview, exam, or travel arrangements I had planned for the morning. It was not working to my liking so I shut off the computer. Then Andrea asked me if it was alright to turn on the television in that room so that she could listen to some talk show because doing so helped her fall asleep. I said sure and walked out of the room because I was distracted by something. I think I walked outside and ended up somehow going to Castro Village because I was strongly craving something to drink from some boba tea shop which only existed in that dream (and not in the &#8220;real life&#8221; version of Castro Village). I walked along a smoothly paved cement path which was lined with small deciduous trees with bright green leaves and lamps which illuminated them nicely. Other people were walking along that path in the opposite direction of me. Once I got to the &#8220;hole in the wall&#8221; restaurant where the boba shop was located (which, in the &#8220;real life&#8221; version of Castro, was located on the corner north of the Mountain Mike&#8217;s Pizza restaurant near the street named Jamison Way) there was a crowd trying to order items before the shop closed for the evening. When it was my turn to order, I looked up at the illuminated menu on the wall and saw a vibrant purple ube flavored boba drink. The young east Asian woman cashiering asked me if I would like the rose flavored boba drink and I asked her if I could have that purple drink on the menu which I was pointing to. She said yes and I told her that I would need to transfer money which was in my personal PayPal account to my business PayPal account (because only the business PayPal account has an associated debit card which lets me treat that account like a bank). I apologized for the delay because my phone was being slow for some reason. Meanwhile, I heard the other employees complaining about how they just wanted to close shop already and how they were in a rush to close it down. Then the lights turned off and I was the only customer in the store. I turned around and saw that they turned off the &#8220;open&#8221; sign and the cashier said, &#8220;You are our lucky last customer,&#8221; in a rather enthusiastic way. I do not ever recall getting my drink (which always seems to happen whenever I am trying to get food or some other prized thing that I want in my dreams after going through trials and tribulations to get it). At other points during my camping experience, I had another rather intense dream about some nerdy and quirky white-ish man who appeared to be between 35 and 50 years old being someone I was spending the summer with camping in his backyard or hanging out in the living room. He had a pet black panther who was behaving like my cat Brea was while I was using the laptop while sitting on the ground by rubbing against me affectionately and laying on the ground while flopping around happily. The man said that his cat was not safe to be around at that time because he appeared to be &#8220;at work&#8221; and hence might want to eat me. I thought the cat was being friendly and not threatening to my safety but I went along with what the guy said. Then I was riding in the car with that guy while he was driving and he was trying to pick a fight with me about how weird I was acting and how I needed to fix my facial expression which looked like a frown (and he proceeded to reach over with his right hand to pinch skin slightly above the bridge of my nose which was apparently furrowed in a pensive or grumpy manner). Then he started crying quite profusely. I was thinking that he was upset with himself and taking it out on me and, when I seemed unflappable, it revealed to him what a loser he felt he was and that is why he was crying. It could also be that he was dropping me off at some kind of part of the world I was not expected to survive in because, shortly after he dropped me off at some random closed in area to camp near a train track which went into an underground cement tunnel, some South American-looking indigenous people showed up begging me to let them use my tent with me. I flat out said no (because I did not want to give up my privacy and share such an intimate space with someone else). I left the premises because I thought they were about to wage war on me or else make a racket. I walked into the tunnel because it seemed to be the only way out and I saw that it was full of deadly hazards including trains going by which almost ran me over.</p>
<p>Anyway, when I woke up and checked my email to see updates about the Teton backpack I ordered from Amazon dot Com, I saw an email saying that the package would be delivered today by UPS and would require a signature to be delivered. I got upset because I thought that no signature was required. I also saw a rather odd text message from my mom which she sent around 10AM in which she said the following: &#8220;Hi Kar. Please let me know if you need the matrix today, as I was thinking of using it today. No problem if you need it. Love you!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Nope, I don&#8217;t need it. Love you too.&#8221; Then I tried calling my dad&#8217;s house phone and his cell phone to see that his cell phone was off and that no one was picking up the house phone. I was going to ask him if the UPS truck showed up and if he could sign the delivery if I did not get home in time to sign the delivery. I alternated between jogging and walking from my campsite to my house because I did not want to miss the chance to get my new backpack on time. I also noticed how my shoes were so worn out that both were falling apart and the right one had a hole on the bottom which caused my foot to make contact with little pieces of gravel and other debris on the ground in a rather uncomfortable manner. I was upset because I was hoping to be able to buy new shoes this weekend and thought that I might have to spend that money on getting a backpack in a brick and mortar store which does not require that I sit at home and wait for the delivery person to arrive and for me to provide the signature in order to receive my package. Fortunately, the UPS truck did show up and I saw the delivery person drop off the box on the porch and turn around without waiting for someone to answer the door to provide a signature (which means that Amazon might have lied to me about my package requiring a signature to be delivered). I opened the door just as the man was walking away and he commented about what a cool cat I have (and Brea was sitting on the driveway watching him and she was also chasing a lizard around and into the garage through the garage door which was open with a gap approximately 8 inches high). I am going to transfer the contents of my old backpack (which is falling apart and has a broken water holder which looks like someone intentionally cut it so that I would not have enough water to stay away from civilization as long as I wanted to) into my new backpack and hike back to wear I left the tent (because my only USB-C to USB computer port cables is in there and I left it behind on accident) in the hopes that no one tampered with my tent while I was away from it. Then I will pack up the tent and probably come back home because I am getting a bit sick of being holed up in that spot away from the coffee, cat, and other nice things which I prefer to spend more time enjoying before going back out into the wilderness where those nice household commodities are not available. My tentative plan is to use the $100 I receive each Friday from my mom to buy some new shoes from the Big 5 sporting goods store in Dublin tomorrow and the $40 which I received today from my mom which I would otherwise be spending on food and coffee today on paying for my AT&amp;T phone bill (which is due on 03_JUNE_2023) and for an extra 3 gigabytes of mobile data (which is essential for me being able to connect my laptop to the Internet when away from Wi-Fi routers).</p>
<p>This is a rather convoluted journal entry. The significance of it (to me) is to remind myself not take Amazon too seriously when it says that I need to provide a signature in order to complete deliveries for gear which is less than $100. I like this brand and model of backpack and it does not seem to be sold in local sporting goods stores. For items which are sufficiently small such as my camping batteries, I can have such items delivered to a local Amazon locker and not worry about packager interception and having to provide signatures. I think Post Office boxes are generally a waste of time because they cost a lot of money to rent and they only allow me to receive small packages for a decent price. I will just assume that my legal residence is a reliable enough place to have packages sent. I would only rent a Post Office box if I had a job while being legitimately homeless.</p>
<p>Note also that I have a USB-C cable which splits into three other cable connector types which allows me to charge my Android phone using a camping battery or my laptop as the power source but that multi-way cable does not allow me to establish a wired Internet connection using my phone as the router. Only the simple USB-C to USB-port cable (which I left in my tent and which costs between $10 and $20) allows for such a connection. Otherwise, I could use my phone to establish a Wi-Fi hotspot (which I am not as big of a fan of because it is not as secure as the wired connection and because only the wired connection allows me to turn off my phone&#8217;s mobile data in order to use the Wi-Fi at my dad&#8217;s house to connect my laptop to that Wi-Fi indirectly because, for whatever reason, my laptop has trouble connecting to the house Wi-Fi directly).</p>
