When I downloaded the photographs which I posted to Instagram today from Instagram and onto my HP "hackintosh" laptop (and I refer to that computer as a "hackintosh" (which I nicknamed "my precious") because I replaced its native Windows 10 operating system with a Ubuntu operating system and the native operating systems of Macintosh computers are also Linux based), I noticed that the image resolution was noticeably lower than the image resolution of the original photographs which I took with my Android phone. Rather than embed those relatively low quality pixelated-looking images from Instagram on this web page, I decided to embed the original images instead. The largest image which is closest to the bottom of this web page is a screenshot of what my Instagram profile currently looks like near the top of the page. (Today I also deleted posts from my Instagram which I thougth were insufficiently high quality or irrelevant to my branding objectives). Finally, within the past 24 hours I have been interacting with chatGPT extensively and learned that none of the C++ code which it output was acomplishing the following objective: <u>write a C++ program which reverse engineers the cmath pow() function without using cmath or math.h library functions.</u> I also noticed that chatGPT outputs in a style which is similar to what I initially input at the beginning of a Playground session. <span style="background:#ffff00">What chatGPT has done for me which is very pragmatically useful is help me write the code (and even the comments for) C++ functions which accomplish relatively simple tasks within the context of the larger program I am in the midst of writing such as determining whether or not a double type input value is a whole number or else a non whole number.</span>
