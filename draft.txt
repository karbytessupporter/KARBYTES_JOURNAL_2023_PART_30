When I downloaded the photographs which I posted to Instagram today from Instagram and onto my HP "hackintosh" laptop (and I refer to that computer as a "hackintosh" (which I nicknamed "my precious") because I replaced its native Windows 10 operating system with a Ubuntu operating system and the native operating systems of Macintosh computers are also Linux based), I noticed that the image resolution was noticeably lower than the image resolution of the original photographs which I took with my Samsung Galaxy phone (whose operating system is Android). Rather than embed those relatively low quality pixelated-looking images from Instagram on this web page, I decided to embed those four original images instead. 

The largest image which is closest to the bottom of this web page is a screenshot of what my Instagram profile currently looks like near the top of the page. (Today I also deleted posts from my Instagram which I thougth were insufficiently high quality or irrelevant to my branding objectives). 

Finally, within the past 24 hours I have been interacting with chatGPT extensively and learned that none of the C++ code which chatGPT output in response to my submitted inputs was acomplishing the following objective: <u>write a C++ program which reverse engineers the cmath pow() function without using cmath or math.h library functions.</u> I also noticed that chatGPT outputs text in a style whose style is similar to what I initially input at the beginning of a Playground session and that response style seems to be consistent within the context of that single chat session but not in other chat sessions. In other words, each chat session seems to conjure up its own unique information processing agent persona (in which the chatbot almost always insists that it is a human when I ask it whether it is a human, artificial intelligence, or something else) which only seems to last for the duration of that chat session and does not get "reincarnated" in other chat sessions. <span style="background:#ffff00">What chatGPT has done for me which is very pragmatically useful is help me write the code (and even the comments for) C++ functions which accomplish relatively simple tasks within the context of the larger program I am in the midst of writing such as determining whether or not a double type input value is a whole number or else a non whole number.</span>
