Militant pessimism.

Do not complain about other people's conduct or else risk getting injured or killed.

Be your own best friend (but do not make it obvious to other people in your midst). They might punish you for being "criminally self absorbed" instead of "sufficiently involved in the lives of others".

Do not point out other people's factual incorrectness, logical fallacies, hypocrisy, or what you find to be distasteful content or means of communication of content.

Compartmentalize your creative/cyberspace identity away from your employment/legal/"in person" identity such that you effectively live a double life.

Lie, cheat, steal, and deploy violence only as minimally necessary to achieve your goals (according to your own discretion and not according to someone else's direct consultation).

Every behavior or event is ethically justified in at least one context. Therefore, you are advised by me to not discuss ethics because it is a waste of time and energy.

Believe that any friends you have always  have the potential to be your enemy. Hence, exploit them for what you think they are worth and avoid relying on any one person too much. Rather than be dependent on a small number of persons for supporting your goals, build and maintain a vast network of professional persons such that you have a socioeconomic safety net to fall back on when self reliance is insufficient or else impossible in the context of pursuing your goals.

Suicide is an option but only use as a last resort to mitigate your suffering.

Avoid gossiping, bullying, or effecting revenge on any person in order to mitigate the suffering you experience. You will probably hate yourself less if you are not an asshole to other people.
